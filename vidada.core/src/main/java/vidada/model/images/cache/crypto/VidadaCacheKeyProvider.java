/**
 * The cache encryption
 * --------------------
 * As a general remark, the cached images are always encrypted.
 * The difference between the two states is, that in DECRYPTED
 * state, the encryption key-pad is freely available in the root folder
 * while in ENCRYPTED state, the key-pad is itself encrypted with the users
 * password. The key-pad has a role similar to a master password.
 * 
 * 
 * DECRYPTED STATE
 * 
 * In the DECRYPTED state, the encryption keypad is saved
 * as "cache.key" in the root folder of the cache. The 
 * keypad is generated randomly the first time a cache is
 * used.
 * 
 * This basically means that the contents are always
 * encrypted, but the key is freely available in the root.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ENCRYPTED STATE
 * 
 * When the cache contents are protected, the "cache.key"
 * gets AES encrypted with the users password and saved as
 * "cache.encrypted". The not encrypted "cache.key" is
 * off course removed.
